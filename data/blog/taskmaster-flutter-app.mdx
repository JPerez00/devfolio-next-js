# Multi-platform Development

After finishing the [TaskMaster iOS App](/blog/taskmaster-ios-app), I wanted to expand the app and make it run in android devices as well. That meant changing environments, languages & stacks.

This also means that the app loses the clean aesthetics or the apple design look, in favour of running in multiple platforms & potentially reaching a lot more users.

So, I created a simple To-Do list that runs on both iOS & Android platforms, and it was created with Flutter & Dart.

## The Development

![code envorinment flutter](/static/images/blog/flutter-app.png)

Android apps are developed with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), which can also be used to work with Kotlin & Java apps.

However, the main framework used was [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), an open source framework by Google, & the language of this framework is [Dart](https://dart.dev/).

Never got the chance to get it up and running on the app store, since you need a dev account and to pay a yearly fee.

You can download the repository and run it locally [here.](https://github.com/JPerez00/Taskmaster_flutter_app)
