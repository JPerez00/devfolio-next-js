# Into Mobile Development

One of my first personal projects (without counting school projecsts) was to create a basic mobile app. I've always been interested in mobile platforms and the reach they can provide.

According to Traffic Share statistics, Mobile platforms represent 65% of all the traffic on the web. You can read the article [here](https://www.similarweb.com/platforms/)

## The Development

iOS apps are developed with [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), the main code editor for apple apps, including the upcoming Apple Vision Pro.

Designed & developed a To-do List iOS App. Implemented with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) & [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata). Compatible with dark mode as well. Works in the XCode iPhone emulator
