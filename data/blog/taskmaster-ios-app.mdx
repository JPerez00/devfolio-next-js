# Into Mobile Development

One of my first personal projects (without counting school projecsts) was to create a basic mobile app. I've always been interested in mobile platforms and the reach they can provide.

According to Traffic Share statistics, Mobile platforms represent 65% of all the traffic on the web. You can read the article [here](https://www.similarweb.com/platforms/)

## The Development

iOS apps are developed with [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), the main code editor for apple apps, including the upcoming Apple Vision Pro.

Designed & developed a To-do List iOS App. Implemented with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) & [Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata). Compatible with dark mode as well. Works in the XCode iPhone emulator.

Core data worked as persistenc memory module (similar to something like Firebase), but built into the apple envorinment.

Never got the chance to get it up and running on the app store, since you need a dev account and to pay a yearly fee.

You can download the repository and run it locally [here.](https://github.com/JPerez00/Taskmaster-A-simple-Todo-List-iOS-App)
