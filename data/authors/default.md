I went to film school and then worked in media and feature films for close to a decade. Then decided I wanted to try something different... I didn't know what yet.

I moved to **Japan for a year**, and while living there, it dawned on me that <span className="custom-underline">the freedom and flexibility of software, creating your own projects & solving problems is the future.</span> I came back to Canada and enrolled in an **Object-Oriented Software Development program at S.A.I.T**.

When most people fully transition between careers, they leave their past skills and experience behind, but I decided to <span className="highlight-yellow">**package all of those skills into a coherent vision**.</span>

So I dedicated myself to developing and combining my interest with valuable skills. That way, itâ€™s much easier to be top 10 or 15 percentile at three or four things than it is to play a zero-sum game and be number one at something.

In my case, <span className="custom-underline">this means merging **Writing, Media & Code**.</span> Hopefully, this provides a sort of "unfair advantage" that people who are a lot more technical/capable or even creative do not have.
